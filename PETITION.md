# Petitions!

Here's how to make them. Log in to https://cosmicjs.com, and navigate to our
dashboard, https://cosmicjs.com/brand-new-congress/dashboard. On the right, click
on `Petitions`.

To edit one of them, click on it and edit the fields.

To make a new one, click `+ Add Petition` in the upper right. Fill out all the fields
and you're good to go.

## JD and BNC

There is one metadata field in the new petition form called `Brands`, with
the possible values `bnc` and `jd`. If you select `bnc`, the petition will be
available at `https://now.brandnewcongress.org/petition/#{slug}`. If you select
`jd`, it will be available at `https://now.justicedemocratcs.com/petition/#{slug}`.
If you select both, it will be available at both.

Good good?
