# Core

## Running Locally

First, install Elixir â€“ for Macs:

```
brew install elixir
```

should work. For anything else, check it: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html.

To start the app locally:
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get` (equivalent of npm install)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
